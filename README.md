# Streaming Backlist - Frontend

## Overview

This repository contains the frontend of my Streaming Backlist application, designed with React and TypeScript for a dynamic, user-centric experience. It works in conjunction with a backend, constructed with Express and PostgreSQL, that handles data from external APIs and user-specific information in the database. Together, they deliver a personalized platform where users can effortlessly manage their Favorites and Watchlater lists, creating a uniquely engaging experience for every user."
